        When I turned 8 years old my parents signed me up for piano lessons. All they wanted was for me to
        be able to play hymns at church. Once I could pass that test of proficiency, I could be done with lessons
        if I wanted. My parents didn’t know then, but they had just started me on my journey to discovering my
        lifelong passion – musicianship. </p>
      <p>I went to my piano teacher’s home once a week. During our first lessons, she taught me how to position
        my hands and the name of each key under my fingers. She taught me how to read sheet music and what all
        the funky markings meant. At home, my parents made me practice piano for 20 minutes each day, cementing
        the concepts I learned in my weekly lessons.</p>
      <p>That 20-minute requirement was a thorn in my side. I would only practice to the moment that the timer
        went off and immediately stop, sighing a deep breath of relief, and skip off to finally go play with my
        toys. But as I slowly progressed in my skills, practicing stopped feeling like a chore. I found my own
        songs to play, which I vastly preferred to the dreadfully boring songs in my lesson books. I began playing
        the piano for hours every day. My parents didn’t bother setting the timer anymore. If I missed a day or
        two of practice, they knew I would make it up later by choice.</p>
      <p>By the time I was 12, my teacher told me that I had fulfilled the original purpose of my lessons – I
        could successfully sightread most of the hymns. But I didn’t want to stop taking lessons. I wanted to see
        how good I could get. So we continued on. At this time, I also started middle school and joined the concert
        band, picking up trumpet and percussion, and dabbling in flute and clarinet. I discovered that piano wasn’t
        the only instrument I was proficient at.</p>
      <p>When I was 14, after six years of piano lessons, my teacher told me that she had nothing left to teach me,
        and so I finished my lessons. I picked up the violin and took lessons for two years, but I eventually
        dropped the violin to focus on school (I was also frustrated because it was the only instrument I couldn’t
        get better at). But even all the while, I still practiced piano for hours each day.</p>
      <p>Now that I’m a college student, it’s so much harder to find the time for piano. I’ll usually go weeks
        without touching one, which sucks because piano was and still is the only way I know to completely clear
        my mind. When I play, it’s like everything else melts away. </p>
      <p>That’s what this website is for. I want to play piano more often, I want to continue to grow my skills,
        and I want to inspire you to go out and do that thing that you love more often. And if you happen to be
        a pianist too, I want to share with you some ideas for cool songs you could learn too.</p>
      <p>I picked two songs (so far) to learn that I will be posting my renditions of here. I’ll share a difficulty
        rating on how hard they were to learn, my overall thoughts, what I liked and disliked about playing them,
        and a side-by-side comparison of the original song and my performance.</p>

        How to Train Your Dragon is one of my favorite movies. I’ve watched it at least 30 times and
        can recite every line of dialogue along with the movie (which yes, is probably very annoying
        for those watching it with me). The soundtrack of this movie is unrivaled. I found this medley
        online, and it combines the most iconic songs from the movie into one. I’m going to compare the
        medley to “Test Drive,” since that’s the song it begins with. The other songs included in this
        medley are “Forbidden Friendship,” “Romantic Flight,” and “Where’s Hiccup?” </p>
      <p>  --videos go here— </p>
      <p>Difficulty Rating: 5/10</p>
      <p>Pros:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Medium length – doesn’t take long to learn</li>
        <li>Tempo is relatively easy to keep up with</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Cons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Multiple key changes</li>
        <li>Tricky fingerings</li>
    </ul>
      <p>I love this medley because it is an accurate portrayal of how the soundtrack sounded. It combines
        the best parts of the best songs. The ending is sweet, somber, and finishes the piece perfectly.
        It’s somewhat simple to learn yet still brings the nostalgia and tugs at your heartstrings.</p>

        I used to hate classical songs, but in high school I had a conversion. This piece by
        Chopin is one of my favorites. </p>
        <p>  --videos go here— </p>
        <p>Difficulty Rating: 5/10</p>
        <p>Pros:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Shorter length</li>
          <li>Repetitive patterns in left hand</li>
          <li>Repeats</li>
      </ul>
        <p>Cons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Many accidentals</li>
          <li>Tricky fingerings</li>
          <li>Faster tempo</li>
      </ul>
        <p>This piece is harder than the HTTYD medley, but it has the same difficulty rating because
          it’s shorter and takes about the same amount of time to learn. This piece is wistful and brings
          to mind a swirling waltz in a grand ballroom.</p>
