                <p>When I turned 8 years old my parents signed me up for piano lessons. All they wanted was for me to
                    be able to play hymns at church. Once I could pass that test of proficiency, I could be done with lessons
                    if I wanted. My parents didn’t know then, but they had just started me on my journey to discovering my
                    lifelong passion – musicianship.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="p2-3">
                <p>I went to my piano teacher’s home once a week. During our first lessons, she taught me how to position
                    my hands and the name of each key under my fingers. She taught me how to read sheet music and what all
                    the funky markings meant. At home, my parents made me practice piano for 20 minutes each day, cementing
                    the concepts I learned in my weekly lessons.</p>
                <p>That 20-minute requirement was a thorn in my side. I would only practice to the moment that the timer
                    went off and immediately stop, sighing a deep breath of relief, and skip off to finally go play with my
                    toys. But as I slowly progressed in my skills, practicing stopped feeling like a chore. I found my own
                    songs to play, which I vastly preferred to the dreadfully boring songs in my lesson books. I began playing
                    the piano for hours every day. My parents didn’t bother setting the timer anymore. If I missed a day or
                    two of practice, they knew I would make it up later by choice.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="p4">
                <p>By the time I was 12, my teacher told me that I had fulfilled the original purpose of my lessons – I
                    could successfully sightread most of the hymns. But I didn’t want to stop taking lessons. I wanted to see
                    how good I could get. So we continued on. At this time, I also started middle school and joined the concert
                    band, picking up trumpet and percussion, and dabbling in flute and clarinet. I discovered that piano wasn’t
                    the only instrument I was proficient at.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="p5">
                <p>When I was 14, after six years of piano lessons, my teacher told me that she had nothing left to teach me,
                    and so I finished my lessons. I picked up the violin and took lessons for two years, but I eventually
                    dropped the violin to focus on school (I was also frustrated because it was the only instrument I couldn’t
                    get better at). But even all the while, I still practiced piano for hours each day.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="p6-7-8">
                <p>Now that I’m a college student, it’s so much harder to find the time for piano. I’ll usually go weeks
                    without touching one, which sucks because piano was and still is the only way I know to completely clear
                    my mind. When I play, it’s like everything else melts away.</p>
                <p>That’s what this website is for. I want to play piano more often, I want to continue to grow my skills,
                    and I want to inspire you to go out and do that thing that you love more often. And if you happen to be
                    a pianist too, I want to share with you some ideas for cool songs you could learn too.</p>
                <p>I picked two songs (so far) to learn that I will be posting my renditions of here. I’ll share a difficulty
                    rating on how hard they were to learn, my overall thoughts, what I liked and disliked about playing them,
                    and a side-by-side comparison of the original song and my performance.</p>
